## Java Coffee Machine

### This is simulator of coffee machine and my first project in Java.
### I took idea from Jet Brains Academy learning projects. This is my realisation of it.
### In this pet project I was training OOP, functions, loops and so on.
### My Coffee Machine can make espresso, cappucino, latte, collect money from customer, give change and have service mode to refill ingredients, set new service password, show earned money.
### Hope you enjoy. 
## Default service password is "0000"
